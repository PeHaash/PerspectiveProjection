# PerspectiveProjection

INTRODUCTION
ever since renaisance, perspective drawing has become one of the most foundamental skills of every architect. with the help of perspective, we can materialize our ideas for other people and ourselvese. However, with the advent of computer-aided modeling, drawing perspectives with hand has lost it's importance in the realm of architectural presentation.
Despite all of the benefits of new computer based techniques of presentation, sometimes, hands-on nature of perspective drawings are lost in the digital world. aesthetics of hand drawings, clear diffrenciation between an image and an idea of a building, use of perspective distortions to accentuate on architectural elements are some of these lost benefits. So I thought we need a tool to re-utilize this technique to the realm of computer drawings.
In this personal project, I tried to make a tool to convert rhino 3d models to perspective drawings, with the help of grasshopper and python. For this project, I implemented three techniques of perspective projection: 2-point, 3-point and 5-point perspective with different approaches. Later, I used these tools in my personal and professional illustrations.
